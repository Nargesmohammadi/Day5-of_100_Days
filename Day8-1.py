# Rewiew:
# Creat a function called greet().


# simple function

# def greet():
# print("Hello Mitra")
# print("How do you do Melo?")
# print("Isn't the weather nice today?")


# print(greet())


# function that allows for input

def greet_with_name(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")
    print(f"How do you do {name}?")
    print("Isn't the weather nice today?")


greet_with_name("Mitra")


# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.
